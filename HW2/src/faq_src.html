                        HTML5 contains powerful capabilities for Web-based applications with more powerful interaction, video support, graphics, more styling effects, and a full set of APIs. HTML5 adapts to any device, whether desktop, mobile, tablet, or television. HTML5 is an open platform developed under royalty free licensing terms.

                        There is huge demand for open standards that allow the creation of rich internet applications. Watching videos, finding the nearest restaurant, accessing emails while being offline are just some of the powerful new capabilities enabled by the set of specifications in development at W3C.

                        One aspect that interests W3C in particular is enabling people to combine different technologies. W3C works to ensure not just interoperable support in software of a single specification, but compatibility among specifications.

                        Even though HTML5 is still a draft, browser vendors are deploying features and generating a lot of excitement in the IT industry. This experience in turn allows W3C to revise its drafts. In this way, the final standard can transparently inform implementers where they need to pay close attention to security and privacy issues.

                        People can already use parts of the platform that interoperate, but W3C's mission is global interoperable, to ensure that the web is available to all. Not all elements are fully implemented yet and some of them provide builtin fallback mechanisms, such as &lt;video&gt; or &lt;input&gt;. One can use HTML5 today, knowing the existing limitations and ensuring proper fallbacks.

                        W3C encourages implementation and testing long before a specification becomes a standard to ensure that two people can read a specification independently and write interoperable software. Early adopters provide implementers and W3C with tremendously valuable feedback because they help identify where interoperability issues exist. For a more detailed understanding of what is currently supported, please see the HTML5 Test Suite Conformance Results (a work in progress).

                        HTML5 is a work in progress. We expect to be feature complete by December 2012. W3C is developing a comprehensive test suite to achieve interoperability for the full specification by 2014, the target date for Recommendation. W3C's primary goal is to ensure that the HTML5 standard is of the highest quality and allows the creation of interoperable implementations. The timeline in the charter is based on implementation expectations and development of a test suite. The timeline is designed to help the industry plan for adoption. Ongoing active participation by browser vendors, other software developers, and the community in implementation and testing will help ensure the successful and timely roll out of the standard.
