                            HTML5, depending on who you listen to, may be either a disruptive new technology that has the potential to bring entire companies to their knees, or a smooth transition from current HTML 4.0 that promises to make life much easier for developers. Both are at least partially true, and in this continuing series, I hope to help you make sense out of HTML5: both business sense and nuts-and-bolts coding-level sense.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                            HTML5 is most definitely a work in progress. It began to take shape back in 2004, and the official specification may not be actually complete until the year 2022! But HTML5 is already here, in everything from your current desktop browser to your new smartphone, so there's no problem with getting started.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="chapter1">So Let's Get Started with HTML5</h3>
                        <p align="left">
                            Perhaps the most important thing to understand about HTML5 is not the coding details and changes themselves, but the high-level functions they give you access to. In fact, HTML5 is all about high-level functions rather than details. For instance, instead of thinking of multimedia objects and then defining them as video or audio and so on, in HTML5 you can simply write something like:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
&lt;video src="watchthis.mp4" width="640" height="480"&gt;<br />
&lt;a href="watchthis.mp4">Here's my video&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;/video&gt;
                        </pre>

                        <h3 id="chapter2">Begin At the Beginning</h3>
                        <p align="left">
                            The only new thing here that will jump out at you is the attribute of contenteditable on the paragraph tag. You can use this on any element, not just a paragraph, and it takes effect for everything within that element. Now, open this file using any modern browser, and you'll see that you can indeed edit the paragraph - but not the heading! - right in the browser.
                            But wait, there's more! Change that paragraph as much as you like, then save the page to your computer as a new HTML file. Open it up in a text editor...and presto, the source code has changed to reflect the text changes you made in the browser. Shazam!
                            Future articles in this continuing series will cover the details of how to use the new HTML5 elements and features (along with working examples, naturally). And we'll keep it real, and readable, without devolving into quoting language syntax by the ton.
